# RUL-Turbofan-engine-

This project will predict the useful remaining life of a turbofan engine based on sensors data and evaluating upon the number of the cycles 
left . Steps included : 

1. Data preprocessing
2. Cleaning and feature engineering
3. made a CNN model and calculated RMSE for each engine .
